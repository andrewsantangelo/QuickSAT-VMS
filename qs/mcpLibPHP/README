phpize
./configure --enable-mcpphp
make
make test (make sure no errors)

Copy the built shared library to the location that the PHP extensions are stored(on my VM this is /usr/lib/php5/20090626/)
sudo cp modules/mcpphp.so /usr/lib/php5/20090626/

add "extension=mcpphp" to the php ini files:
/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini
/etc/php5/cli/php.ini

Start MCP:
sudo service mcp start

On the command line run the following command, If MCP is running and there are
no errors and you get a number (should be "1") in response, then the MCP PHP extension was correctly compiled and installed.
php -r 'echo mcp_get_state() . "\n";'
